    <h3>What is Sorigin?</h3>
    <p>
        Sorigin is a service which aims to unify player identification in the Beat Saber community.
        Some services and platforms need to link a player to different social platforms like Discord and Steam.
        However, it can be cumbersome for a service to handle authenticating users with all those platforms,
        and it can be annoying for users to have to log into multiple platforms.
