            Sorigin is a service which aims to unify player identification in the Beat Saber community.
            Some services and platforms need to link a player to different social platforms like Discord and Steam.
            However, it can be cumbersome for a service to handle authenticating users with all those platforms,
            and it can be annoying for users to have to log into multiple platforms.
